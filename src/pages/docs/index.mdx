**Under the hood** Storacha uses [UCANs](https://github.com/ucan-wg/spec) for trustless, local-first authorization, and is backed by the provable storage of [IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.tech/) and [Filecoin](https://docs.filecoin.io/basics/what-is-filecoin).

When it comes down to building your next application, service, or website, Storacha keeps it simple. You get all the benefits of decentralized storage technologies with the frictionless experience you expect in a modern dev workflow. **All you need to use Storacha is a key-pair and your data.**
